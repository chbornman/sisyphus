# Privacy Policy for Sisyphus

**Last Updated: November 10, 2025**

## Overview

Sisyphus is a privacy-first happiness tracking app. Your emotional journey is yours alone. We don't collect, transmit, or store any of your personal data on our servers.

## Data Collection

**We collect ZERO data.**

Sisyphus does not:
- Require an account or login
- Collect personal information
- Track your location
- Use analytics or crash reporting services
- Share data with third parties
- Transmit data over the internet

## Data Storage

All happiness tracking data is stored **locally on your device** using SQLite. This includes:
- Happiness scores for each timeslot
- Descriptions and notes you add
- Your notification preferences
- Theme and color settings

This data:
- Never leaves your device
- Is not backed up to cloud services by the app
- Can be deleted by deleting the app

## Notifications

If you enable notifications:
- Notifications are scheduled locally on your device
- No data is sent to external servers
- You can customize or disable notifications at any time in Settings

## Device Permissions

Sisyphus requests the following permissions:

### Notifications (Optional)
- **Purpose**: Send half-hourly reminders to track your happiness
- **Controlled by you**: Can be enabled/disabled in app Settings
- **No data collected**: Notifications are generated locally

## Data Security

Since all data stays on your device:
- Your data is protected by your device's security (passcode, Face ID, Touch ID)
- If you use iCloud backup, iOS may back up the app's data as part of your device backup
- Deleting the app permanently removes all data

## Children's Privacy

Sisyphus does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under 13. Since no data leaves the device, there are no special considerations for children's use.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the app and on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date.
