WHY TRACK HAPPINESS?
What gets measured gets improved. By tracking your happiness throughout the day, you'll start noticing patterns you never saw before. Maybe you're happiest in the morning, or perhaps certain activities consistently boost your mood. Sisyphus gives you the data to make informed decisions about how you spend your time.

The name "Sisyphus" reminds us that happiness isn't a destination—it's found in the daily effort of pushing the boulder up the hill. By tracking your journey, you'll find joy in the process itself.
